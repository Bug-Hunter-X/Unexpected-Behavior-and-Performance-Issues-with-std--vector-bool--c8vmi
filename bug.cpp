std::vector<bool> is a specialized container in C++ that stores boolean values.  While it might seem efficient due to its compact memory usage (packing multiple booleans into a single byte), it often causes unexpected behavior and performance issues.  The primary problem is that it doesn't provide the same interface as other standard containers like `std::vector<int>` or `std::vector<char>`.  For example, accessing elements using the `[]` operator doesn't return a boolean, but instead returns a proxy object.  This proxy object is used to ensure the space-saving behavior, but it leads to more complex code and slower performance.  Operations like copying and assigning `std::vector<bool>` objects can be significantly slower than with other containers due to this proxy mechanism.
